    "description": "Learn the building blocks of programming so you can easily learn any computer programming language! Those approaches remind me of a guitar teacher I had years ago. He had two instructional methods - neither of which worked for me. He would either teach me to play one specific song, then I could play that song - but nothing else. Or he would play something complicated while I sat, watching him. I was supposed to pick up his guitar-playing skills by osmosis I guess, but that didn't happen. I've taught computer programming for many years and have found the most effective approach is to teach the tools one by one, giving exercises or assignments that allow students to practice each new concept until mastered. As the student learns, he or she gradually builds larger, more complex programs. While this may not be the most glamorous technique - it works! Students gain confidence as they truly understand how to use the programming tools."
